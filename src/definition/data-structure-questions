Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A.we use it to organise data
-array , file , record , table , tree ...


**What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
traversing , searching , adding , removing , sorting

**List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
database managment system ,compiler design , operating system

**what is an Array?
juste like simple variable it has a type but array stores multiples values (a block of memory)

**what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
in array we have to give the size at the creation and the size can't be expended
in arraylist we can expend the size its dynamic but also arrylist are limited because values are stored one after the other
so if at some point we don't have enough space to add another just after the previous one we can't add it

**what is LinkedList?
linkedlist are created to solve the arraylist capacity problem . it's juste like arraylist but the values
are not followed by eachother they are instead linked using the previous address and the next address

**How is an Array different from Linked List?
in array we don't have links that linkes between elements
but in linked list we have links to realte between elements previous and next

**what is queue?
designed to have elements stored at the end of the gueue and removed from the begining

**what is stack?
stack follows LIFO last in first out so data are inserted at the head and removed from the head

**what is FIFO and LIFO?
FIFO means first in first out data is inserted at the end of the list and removed from the begining
LIFO means last in first out data is inserted at the beginig ot the list and removed from the begining

**what is the order of complexity?
certain mathematiacl expressions of the size of the input and the algorithm finishes between two factors of it

**what is the best case to search an element from an array?
-Binary search

**what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Hypothetical data set

**what is tree in data structure?
is a hierarchical data structure using connected nodes

**what is graph in data structure?
items connected by edges each item is node

**what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Hashtable is synchronised but not Hashmap
Hashtable does not allow null values but hashmap does

**What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
RDMS : array
Network data : Graphs
Hierarchical : tree

**How HashMap works in java?
hashmap stores keys and values

**What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
is an exception thrown when java tries to acces an invalid index

**What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Object.clone()
Arrays.copyOf()
Arrays.copyOfRange()
System.arrayopy()

**What is difference between an array and a linked list?
in array elements are independent but in linked list elements are related
in array no pointers are used but in linked list we use pointer to relate between elements previous and next

**What is DFS and BFS?
Depth first search : method to explore a tree or graph we go untill the end of the branch and then go back to the begining and search with another node
Breadth first search : method to explore tree and graph but this method we search all the nodes in one step and then go deeper with the next step

**What is Recursion?
is a process in which methods calls themselves in the body of the method

**What are linear and non linear data Structures?
linear : array , Stack , queue , linkedlist
non linear : tree , graphs

**What is Big-(O)-notation?
used to describe the complexity of an algorithm

**Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Insertion sort,Selection sort,Merge sort,Heapsort,Quicksort,Bubble sort,Shellsort,Comb sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
